  <text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This first-person account was written by a young woman about her experience with Cushing syndrome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been a bit of a “skinny-Minnie” and had no major health issues. But in 1997 I started having irregular periods. Not only that, but I started gaining weight—6 to 9 pounds every month. I knew something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This began my year-long journey with Cushing syndrome. Initially, I saw two general practitioners, had blood work done, and was told I was fine. As I gained more weight, Cushing’s symptoms became more apparent. I developed striae (purplish marks on my thighs *), a big round “moon face,” and a humpback.&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; I also became extremely fatigued when performing simple tasks. At the time, however, I had no idea or clue of what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, I saw my gynecologist. Again, more blood work, and I was told I’m fine. This process continued on with three other doctors. I pressed on from feeling misunderstood, depressed, and utterly tired and found an endocrinologist. After 3 months of testing, he located the problem: a tumor on my right adrenal gland. A month later I had a right adrenalectomy. Thankfully, my left adrenal works great, and I don’t have to take any hormone pills. I was also thrilled that the 72 pounds I gained over the year melted away in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget this experience. Having an unknown medical condition is very stressful. In some ways, I think I was even more stressed and depressed because my doctors seemed to dismiss my symptoms. I didn’t own a computer at the time, and I asked a friend to do some online research for me. I really felt I had to educate myself. I still don’t know what caused the adrenal gland tumor or if I could have prevented it. But I am pretty much back to normal, and my Cushing’s journey taught me to be a better advocate for myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tanzie Johnson is a professional photographer living in New York City.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>

  <text>&lt;p&gt;* The weight gain in Cushing syndrome stretches the skin, which becomes thin and weakened, allowing small hemorrhages to occur in the thinned-out tissue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;Fat pads accumulate along the collarbone and on the back of the neck (“buffalo hump”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: The diagnosis of Cushing syndrome can take months to years, because its symptoms can be confused with those of many other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
