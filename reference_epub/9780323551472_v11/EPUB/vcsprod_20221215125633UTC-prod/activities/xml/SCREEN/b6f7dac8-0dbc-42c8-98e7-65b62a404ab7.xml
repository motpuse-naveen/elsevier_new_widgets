  <text>&lt;p&gt;Whenever May rolls around, I think about my surgery and the decision I made many years ago to have prophylactic mastectomies. I grew up in a family of strong women. They were determined to work, play sports, and raise their families, except they all had breast cancer. It was a bump in the road for each one of them and, at age 36, I had 4 children, a wonderful career and a husband and abnormal mammograms. I had friends, holidays, and biopsies, and being a physician (radiation oncologist) and the daughter of a medical oncologist, I was worried about my own health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my mother tested negative for the BRCA gene, it did not relieve my anxiety. It just intensified it. What was causing the breast cancer in my family? Genetic counselors explained that only about 15% of breast cancer can be attributed to the BRCA genes; the rest are caused by other “faulty genes” or just changes in the breast cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard about a new procedure that physicians were pioneering—direct-to-implant breast reconstruction after mastectomy. One step and one surgery would drop my risk from 40% to close to 2% or 3%. I could preserve my anatomy and get rid of those breast cells that might kill me someday. It had a lot to do with my family and career. I did not want to have breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I decided, after much research and discussion, to have prophylactic mastectomies with reconstruction. On a Tuesday in the first week of May 2006, I had my surgery. My mother was there when I woke up from anesthesia, and I have never seen her so relieved. My husband took care of the kids, closed the car doors for me, and took over mowing the lawn for a while. I didn’t discuss my surgery, especially not with the freedom that Angelina Jolie did in 2013. In 2006, no one had heard of my surgery; they couldn’t even pronounce the name of it. But I was convinced that it meant I might very well “dodge a bullet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine years later, I smile when I see morning television shows talk about the “Angelina Effect”—implants and breast reconstruction, nipples, and risk reduction, all in the same story. It’s wonderful that women can talk about their “faulty parts” without feeling shame. It’s a great example for our daughters as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March of 2015, Angelina wrote another op-ed, discussing her oophorectomy and salpingectomy surgery (removal of both ovaries and both fallopian tubes). Women with BRCA genes have an increased risk not only for breast cancer but also for ovarian cancer. And this was the disease that took Angelina’s mother’s life. Ovarian cancer, unlike breast cancer, is often diagnosed at a very late stage. A majority of breast cancers are diagnosed at stage 1 or 2 or even at a “pre-cancer” DCIS [ductal carcinoma in situ] stage. Ovarian cancer, on the other hand, often is diagnosed after the cancer has already spread. Angelina also discussed another “taboo” subject: Removing ovaries and the fallopian tubes in a premenopausal woman (Angelina was 39 years old at the time of her surgery) sends her into early menopause. Hot flashes, skin changes, dryness (you know where) are hard topics to discuss in public. She put it out there, front and center, to destigmatize the subject for all women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no history of ovarian cancer in my family, and we are BRCA-negative, so my genetic counselor did not recommend removing my ovaries and fallopian tubes. Rather, I have a pelvic ultrasound once a year and a blood test (CA-125) to make sure that nothing is abnormal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of my decision to undergo prophylactic mastectomies, I know that my life has changed for the better. I don’t have the fear of getting breast cancer. I also have decided to devote my life work to helping women recover with comfort, dignity, and grace after being blindsided by the disease. Angelina Jolie says that knowledge is power! It behooves us to learn as much as we can to prevent disease and proactively take care of the fragile, precious thing we call our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elizabeth Chabner Thompson is the CEO/Founder of Masthead, a company devoted to bringing innovative products to patients with breast cancer. She is a physician, swimmer, cross country skier and the proud mother of four children ages 16-21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>
