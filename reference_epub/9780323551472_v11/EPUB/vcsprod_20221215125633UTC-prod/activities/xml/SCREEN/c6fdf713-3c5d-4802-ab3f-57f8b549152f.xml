  <text>&lt;p&gt;The male sex cell, the &lt;strong&gt;spermatozoon &lt;/strong&gt;(sperm cell), is microscopicâ€”in volume, only one third the size of a red blood cell and less than 1/100,000 the size of the female ovum. A relatively uncomplicated cell, the sperm is composed of a head region, containing nuclear hereditary material (chromosomes), and a tail region, consisting of a &lt;strong&gt;flagellum &lt;/strong&gt;(hair-like process). The flagellum makes the sperm motile and makes it look somewhat like a tadpole. The spermatozoon cell contains relatively little food and cytoplasm, because it lives only long enough (3 to 5 days) to travel from its point of release from the male to where the egg cell lies within the female reproductive tract (fallopian tube). Only one spermatozoon out of approximately 300 million sperm cells released during a single &lt;strong&gt;ejaculation &lt;/strong&gt;(ejection of sperm and fluid from the male urethra) can penetrate a single ovum and result in fertilization of the ovum. Figure 9-1 shows a diagram of a&lt;strong&gt; sperm cell &lt;/strong&gt;and a photograph of &lt;strong&gt;spermatozoa&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If more than one egg is passing down the fallopian tube when sperm are present, multiple fertilizations are possible, and twins, triplets, quadruplets, and so on may occur. Twins resulting from the fertilization of separate ova by separate sperm cells are called&lt;strong&gt; fraternal twins&lt;/strong&gt;. Fraternal twins, developing with separate placentas, can be of the same sex or different sexes and resemble each other no more than ordinary brothers and sisters. Fraternal twinning is hereditary; the daughters of mothers of twins can carry the gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identical twins&lt;/strong&gt; result from fertilization of a single egg cell by a single sperm. As the fertilized egg cell divides and forms many cells, it somehow splits, and each part continues separately to undergo further division, each producing an embryo. The split usually occurs between the third and fifth days of embryonic development. Most identical twins have one placenta and two amniotic sacs. Identical twins have the same DNA and are, therefore, of the same sex and of very similar form and feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organs of the male reproductive system are designed to produce and release billions of spermatozoa throughout the lifetime of a male from puberty onward. In addition, the male reproductive system secretes a hormone called &lt;strong&gt;testosterone&lt;/strong&gt;. Testosterone is responsible for the production of the bodily characteristics of the male (such as beard, pubic hair, and deeper voice) and for the proper development of male gonads &lt;strong&gt;(testes)&lt;/strong&gt; and accessory organs (&lt;strong&gt;prostate gland&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;seminal vesicles&lt;/strong&gt;) that secrete fluids to ensure the lubrication and viability of sperm.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
