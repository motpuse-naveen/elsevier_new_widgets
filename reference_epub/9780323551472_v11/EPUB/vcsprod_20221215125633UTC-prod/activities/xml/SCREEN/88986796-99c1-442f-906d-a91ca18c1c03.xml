  <text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following first-person narrative provides a detailed look at two common diagnostic procedures—CT and MRI—from the perspective of the patient. It was written by a 77-year-old woman with head and neck cancer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#684182;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CT—COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before an upcoming surgical procedure, I was told that I would need to have a CT scan. The doctors wanted to see if the cancer on my scalp had spread into the bones in my skull. They explained that these images of my head would be in thin “slices,” taken as the CT camera rotated around me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I arrived in the room, I saw the CT machine. It was a large, circular hollow tube about 18 inches wide. There was a narrow table through the center. It was clear to me immediately that I would not have to worry about feeling “closed in.” I lay down on the table, and the technician explained he would add contrast through an intravenous (IV) line halfway through the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The table was rolled into the machine to a specific spot where a series of pictures were taken. There were several short periods when I was asked to stay as still as possible and hold my breath. The noise was minimal, just soft whirring and clicking. Halfway through the procedure, I was slid out of the machine on the table so that the contrast could be added to the IV line. Once I was back in the machine, more pictures were taken and the test was completed with a minimum of discomfort, much to my grateful surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#684182;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MRI—MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style="color:#3c3c3c;"&gt;Before yet another surgery procedure, my doctors requested an MRI exam. This time, they wanted to get the best possible image of my malignant tumor and the surrounding area. They explained that the MRI and CT procedures are similar in that they both produce images in thin slices, but that MRI shows more detail, especially of soft tissue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#3c3c3c;"&gt;The technician confirmed I had nothing metal (such as a pacemaker or surgical screws) inside or on my body. The magnet that is used in the MRI machine is so strong that it could cause any metal objects to shift. This movement could disrupt the imaging process or cause damage to tissue in my body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#3c3c3c;"&gt;The MRI machine is a 6-foot-long round tube, open on both ends. Because the body part to be examined was my head, a rubber shield was placed over and very close to my face to hold me in the correct position. I was then rolled inside to the middle of the tube. This was really uncomfortable for me because I have mild claustrophobia. I took deep breaths to relax myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#3c3c3c;"&gt;Although the technicians had told me the procedure would be loud, I was still taken aback by just how loud it was inside the tube. Even though I was wearing earplugs, the sound was like the pounding of huge hammers held by giant arms, or of heavy-duty jackhammers. At the same time, there was an abrupt shaking of the entire machine from side to side. I knew immediately that this could be an overwhelming experience, so I used the “relax-substitution” method to replace these violent sounds with more familiar ones. I remembered a very loud time as my family and I made our way to Nantucket Island on a ferry for a brief vacation. Now the previously strident and threatening sound was replaced by the welcoming sound of the ferry horn bellowing a happy welcome to the visitors’ smiling faces as they came onto the ferry with straw hats, sunscreen, backpacks, and duffel bags. This relaxation method was extremely effective for me. I was then rolled out of the machine for addition of the IV contrast, and the process was repeated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#3c3c3c;"&gt;I am still amazed that the doctors could get such detailed information on what was going on inside my body using these two tests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>
