  <text>&lt;p&gt;Possible heart attack? You have to be kidding. I had none of the supposed symptoms—shortness of breath or chest pain. Instead, I had bouts of atrial fibrillation off and on for several months. I got tired easily, and I could feel my blood pressure drop. After lying down for about an hour, I was fine, so in November 2010 I decided to get it checked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My cardiologist decided to do a stress test. He put me on a treadmill, which seemed like an eternity, and then did some ultrasound on me. I work out every day on a treadmill and a recumbent bike, so the test on the treadmill wasn’t that difficult, although I loved the words “just a couple of seconds to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cardiologist at Johns Hopkins told me after the stress test that it appeared that I had a slight blockage of an artery. No problem, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angioplasty was recommended. During angioplasty, a catheter was inserted up my right arm, and although I was lightly sedated, I still felt it, particularly when the doctor hit a problem and had to make a slight correction. I was certain that they would put in a stent and I’d be home by the weekend. “No,” said my doctor. “You have three blockages and will need bypass surgery.” I thought he must be talking about someone else. That can’t be me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blockages did not require immediate surgery. After all, I was pain free and asymptomatic. Still, I asked for an early date for surgery, and it was set for January 11, 2011. (That was 1/11/11. How odd.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The triple coronary artery bypass opened me up like a beached tuna and made me an official member of the “zipper club.” The atrial fibrillation was fixed with radiofrequency ablation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After surgery I had to lie on my back, which meant minimal sleep for a week. Lasix (a diuretic) was my biggest problem, along with a dozen pills I had to take far too often. According to my surgeon, who visited me a day later, things went well, and I was up and walking the hallways of Hopkins with the help of a nurse and a walker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went home in a week. The toughest part of the ordeal, oddly enough, was trying to get to the bathroom in time and the bumpy ride home. Those bumps made me hold that pillow [for abdominal support] as close as I could. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I returned home, two nurses came for home care, and they were fabulous. I lost about 20 pounds before the surgery and another 17 pounds afterward. I went from 210 pounds to around 173 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, I eat no red meat, nothing with butter, and as little fat and salt as possible. In other words, I eat fish primarily. I work out every day (between 30 and 60 minutes), and I have regular checkups with my cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was lucky that the atrial fibrillation alerted my physicians to a deeper problem that may have resulted in a heart attack or even death. Secondly, I was fortunate to have some true professionals on hand to get me through the darkest days of my life. Many people who had bypass surgery told me I would have more energy after surgery due to my new plumbing. That occurred within 6-7 months after my surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stan Ber was born in Maine and is a graduate of Bowdoin College.
