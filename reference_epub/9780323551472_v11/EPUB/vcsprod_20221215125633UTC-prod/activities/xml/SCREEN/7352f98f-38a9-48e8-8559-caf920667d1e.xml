  <text>&lt;p&gt;One day, while out for my usual walk, I sneezed on account of the higher seasonal pollen in our area. It was not an easy sneeze, and I was aware of the result immediately: I noticed some new floaters in my left eye. No pain, but a little feeling that something wasn’t right. I did not see flashes of bright light (a good thing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hoped that the floaters would minimize and when they did not, I called my optometrist for an appointment. My appointment was at 10:30, and by 11:00 he had discovered a possible tear in my left retina. He walked me down the hall to an ophthalmologist, who confirmed the tear and suggested cryopexy, which involves numbing the eye, inserting an external probe into the area of the eye and freezing the torn retina to the back of the eye. I was through all of this by 11:30. Timing is everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ophthalmologist explained that waiting two or three days could have allowed the tear to progress to a detachment—which, if not caught, could cause more serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think about a sneeze, it involves the head moving forward and stopping abruptly. As we get older, the clear jell (vitreous) inside the eye may pull away from the retina at the back of the eye. If this pulls away gradually, usually there is no problem. However, if there is a hard pull with a tear, the vitreous can pass through the tear, lifting the retina off the back of the eye, much like the way wallpaper can peel off a wall. There are a number of conditions that may lead to the chance of retinal problems, such as nearsightedness, cataract surgery, glaucoma, or family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As explained to me, if you are going to sneeze, grasp your head with both hands (perhaps while holding a tissue to your nose) to prevent the head from moving radically. That may stop a sudden front-to-back movement of your head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that I couldn’t play golf for a couple of weeks after the cryopexy. My left eye looked horrible (itching and swollen) and I had a bunch of dark floaters in it. It was like trying to dodge three or four gnats right in front of my face. The good news is that my vision is intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My doctor told me that once you have had one episode, there is a 15% chance of developing the same problem in the other eye. Right on schedule, a year later, my right eye had a tear/separation. This time, though, the separation was located on the nasal side of the eye, which precluded using the cryogenic method of sealing the retina. My choice, in his office at least, was for a laser correction. I asked about the particulars, including safety, whether it would correct the problem, and how long the procedure would take. I was given assurances for my first two concerns, and told the procedure might take 5 minutes. I agreed to do it, but had concerns about how I could stay still for 5 minutes while he fired laser shots through my eye to stitch up the tear. After numbing the eye and putting me in the correct position, the doctor proceeded to light up my eye with 30 very bright flashes. He finished in 15 seconds. While I was pulling back from the head rest, I asked why had he told me that it would take 5 minutes. He said, with a little smile, that he didn’t want me to starting figuring his fee based on a per second basis while I was undergoing the treatment. Pretty clever, and worth the smile that I gave him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, both eyes are fine. I still have floaters in both eyes and occasionally swipe at nonexistent gnats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may have no relation, but my golf handicap has dropped four shots lower since last spring and two below my historical prior low. Isn’ t technology great or what?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mac McGinnis is a retired businessman and dedicated golfer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>
