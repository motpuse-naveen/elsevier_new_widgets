  <text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This first-person narrative is by a woman who experienced radiation therapy for breast cancer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My life changed forever when I got that phone call that no one wants to hear: “Your biopsy is malignant.” So after they tell you that you have cancer, you are scared to death, begin to contemplate your mortality, and wonder how to break the news to your husband, children, loved ones, and friends. You settle down, and marshal up your strength to fight this beast that attacks too many of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my biopsy, I met with a team that included my surgeon, my radiation oncologist, and my medical oncologist. It was decided that the best course of action was to perform a lumpectomy to remove the malignant tissue in my breast. At the same time, I would also have a sentinel node biopsy to check for lymphatic invasion. Surgery would be followed by a course of radiation therapy and then a 5-year regimen of the drug tamoxifen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 3 weeks after the surgery, I met with my radiation oncologist. She explained all the benefits and risks associated with radiation. At my first radiotherapy appointment, technicians created a mold to hold my breast in the exact position for treatment. I was marked on both sides of my body with indelible ink to place the mold correctly each visit. I also received a small permanent tattoo on the middle of my breastbone that enabled the machine to correctly target the beams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my first day of treatment, as I walked into the radiation room, I noticed hundreds of molds for other patients stacked up against the wall. The technicians positioned me into my mold and calibrated the machine against the markings on my body. When all the bodily GPS settings were in sync, they scurried out of the room to stand behind the giant lead walls (the cowards). A giant circular radiation machine began to move closer, gyrating slowly back and forth until it was properly fixed. A pulse of light shot out and a humming sound began. The machine gradually rotated, sending radiation to my breast. The entire treatment session lasted less than 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My side effects of radiation included fatigue and skin irritation from folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles). Even after my treatments ended, side effects (blisters and even bleeding) continued. Time, however, brought healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am amazed at what my journey revealed. Most of all, it taught me about how wonderful friends can be, how much of a difference support groups can make, and why dedicated medical professionals deserve so much thanks and praise. A very lovely woman I met along the way shared some wisdom that I will pass along to all of you reading my story. She said, “At first cancer is your whole world, then it becomes a room, then it becomes a drawer in that room, and then it becomes a box in the drawer.” I still take that box out once in a while, but not as often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mary Braun is Vice President, Investments at Chapin Davis, Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>
