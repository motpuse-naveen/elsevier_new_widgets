  <text>&lt;p&gt;I was born with a right congenital hip dysplasia and put into iron braces until I could walk normally. At 11 months, the braces were removed and I was deemed healthy, but my right foot, always turned outward. It never got in my way and held up for over 100 marathons, until 2012 when I developed a deep aching pain in my groin, a telltale sign of hip pathology and my running became more difficult. In the spring of 2016, at the advice of my chiropractor, I had an x-ray of my pelvis with a views of my right hip. The diagnosis was right hip severe osteoarthritis, bone on bone. (Figure 15-40A and B)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prognosis for this sort of condition can be variable. Some people can avoid joint replacement for years, with limited activity, but I was having pain with any flexion of my hip. In December of 2016, I had a corticosteroid injection into the joint space with the goal of reducing some of the inflammation resulting from the femoral head rubbing against the acetabulum. My only painless motion was lateral, where my hip could rotate without osteophytes and bone spurs limiting motion. Over the years I had worn down my femoral head so that it was no longer round but rather flat from bone rubbing on bone. (See Figure 15-40C.) Although I took NSAID’s for pain, when the pain continued all night, I decided to look into hip replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I selected a surgeon who operated with an anterior approach and used a special Hana table, to position my leg for optimal placement of the femoral stem prosthesis. Artificial hips are comprised of 3 components: the titanium femoral stem, the femoral head either chromium cobalt or ceramic, and the acetabular portion which can be metal with a polyethylene liner. See Figure 15-34 on page 584. Because I wanted an approach that did not cut through any muscle and with the lowest dislocation risk, I decided upon an anterior approach. The entire procedure took about 60 minutes (see post operative x-ray below in Figure 15-40D) and within 6 hours they had me up and walking on my new hip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most challenging part of the post-op period was extreme nausea resulting from the anesthesia and narcotics used to curb my postoperative pain. I decided to discontinue the narcotics. Because I was laying in bed for hours on end, in between my PT, I wore compression hose and special boots that inflated and deflated on schedule to move blood through my legs. This prevented deep vein thromboses. I also was put on a blood thinner (anticoagulant) to prevent the dangerous clots which could easily migrate to my lungs (pulmonary emboli).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a period of a week, I gradually grew stronger. I progressed from a walker to using a cane in my left hand. I practiced using my stronger left leg first going up stairs and my weaker right leg-cane combination first when going down stairs. I took it slowly. I iced my hip constantly, never going any where or lying down without ice packs to reduce the inflammation, pain and swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing my walking and adding daily PT helped me feel stable on my feet within a few weeks. My surgeon hypothesized that by 6 weeks, I would feel like my new hip was my own and take aerobic exercise gradually from there. I can’t wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elizabeth Chabner Thompson is the CEO/Founder of Masthead, a company devoted to bringing innovative products to patients with breast cancer.
