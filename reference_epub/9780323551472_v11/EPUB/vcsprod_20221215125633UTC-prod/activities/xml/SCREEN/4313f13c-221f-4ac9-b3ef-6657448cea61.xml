  <text>&lt;p&gt;The primary function of blood is to maintain a constant environment for the other living tissues of the body. Blood transports nutrients, gases, and wastes to and from the cells of the body. Nutrients from food, digested in the stomach and small intestine, pass into the bloodstream through the lining cells of the small intestine. Blood then carries these nutrients to all body cells. Oxygen enters the body through the air sacs of the lungs. Red blood cells then transport the oxygen to cells throughout the body. Blood also helps remove the waste products released by cells. It carries gaseous waste (such as carbon dioxide) to the lungs to be exhaled. It carries chemical waste, such as urea, to the kidneys to be excreted in the urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood transports chemical messengers called hormones from their sites of secretion in glands, such as the thyroid or pituitary, to distant sites where they regulate growth, reproduction, and energy production. These hormones are discussed later in the endocrine chapter, page 699.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, blood contains proteins, white blood cells and antibodies that fight infection, and platelets (thrombocytes) and other proteins that help the blood to clot.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
