  <text>&lt;p&gt;Prior a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus, I was drinking what seemed like gallons of water a day. I first thought it was great to always want water because I was aware the daily recommendations. But it quickly became apparent that I couldn’t go for more than 30 minutes without drinking at least 8 ounces or more. If I didn’t have water every 20-30 minutes, I would produce a foam-like substance in my mouth feel the urge urinate. In fact, as I was drinking so much water I was also producing clear urine very frequently. I was unable to sleep throughout the night awoke with my heart racing, feeling extremely thirsty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I went to my physician, she drew blood and the results showed low levels of a hormone called vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone. I was diagnosed with diabetes insipidus and started taking a medication called desmopressin (commonly known as DDVSP) to replace the hormone from pituitary gland. An MRI showed that I had a pituitary adenoma, which was the cause of the decrease in hormone secretion. Three months later I had the transsphenoidal surgery to remove growth on my pituitary gland. Remnants of the tumor were removed through my nasal passages. Now my symptoms have improved, but I continue to take desmopressin as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kemisha White is a Boston native and beach lover!
