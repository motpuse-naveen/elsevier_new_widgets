  <text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This first-person narrative was written by a kidney donor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my 64-year-old father-in-law announced to my wife and me that his kidney function was failing, it didn’t really enter our minds that one of us might ultimately have a part to play in his survival. Five years later, dialysis was taking its toll on his organ systems, and there had been no success in obtaining a cadaveric kidney. Things had reached the point where he needed a kidney in short order, before his health deteriorated to the point where he would no longer be a candidate for transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wife’s blood type ruled out the possibility of her being a direct donor, so I volunteered to be tested. Turns out that her father and I were a match on 5 of the 7 key traits—a really good fit! The next round of testing—blood work and my kidney function—was able to be done locally. I remember carrying around a specimen container (on ice), having to provide a full liter of urine in 24 hours!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of those tests were favorable, and two weeks later I made the &lt;span role="math" aria-label="3 bevelled 1 half"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mn&gt;3&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mfrac bevelled="true"&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-hour drive to the transplant center at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. While a transplant is really a team of two—donor and recipient—the entire process at UVA was very much individualized. A transplant coordinator (an experienced RN) was assigned specifically to our case, and I had a team of doctors and support staff dedicated exclusively to me, the donor. Similarly, there was a team that dealt only with my father-in-law as the recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My visit involved some more in-depth blood tests and cardiac studies largely to determine that I was healthy enough for major surgery. My transplant team and I spent an entire afternoon discussing the implications of being a donor—the inherent risk in any surgery, potential implications for me and my family, the likely recovery time, and the possibility that, despite all of the up-front testing, the transplant might not be successful. The discussions that afternoon only reaffirmed that I was making the right decision. I had an opportunity to have a positive impact on someone else’s life, with relatively little risk to my own health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The events around the surgery itself were pretty straightforward. The surgery is a more involved procedure for the donor than for the recipient, so I was taken back first. A nurse started an IV and injected a mild sedative. From that point, my only memory is of one last hug for my wife and children, and then being shifted from the stretcher onto the operating table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I woke up in recovery, the news was all good. My surgery had gone well—four laparoscopic incisions through which the surgeons did most all of their work, and a lateral incision in my lower abdomen through which the kidney was removed. Equally important, my father-in-law had come through his surgery well and the kidney had immediately begun to function! I was discharged from the hospital on Sunday, and cleared to return home the next Friday, 8 days post-op.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is typical following a major surgery, it took about 6 weeks for me to feel “normal” again. During those 6 weeks, I had weekly blood tests to chart the progress of my kidney function. I went back to UVA for a routine follow-up visit at the 6-week mark. I was recovering as expected, and my remaining kidney was actually growing in size and capacity. Blood tests continued on a monthly basis until I was officially “discharged” from the transplant center’s care 6 months after the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, 8 years after the transplant, both my father-in-law and I continue to do well. As my mother-in-law likes to say, I donated a “rock star” kidney that has allowed our family to enjoy many visits and create many cherished memories that will last a lifetime. My two children, now 20 and 17, have enjoyed their grandfather’s love and guidance during some very important years in their lives. This is especially meaningful to me, as I lost my father before my wife and I started our family, and our children missed out on an opportunity to know and love a wonderful man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Melson lives in Greensboro, North Carolina.
