  <text>&lt;p&gt;This chapter gives you practice in word building, while not introducing a large number of new terms. It uses many familiar terms from Chapter 5, which should give you a breather after your hard work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study the suffixes presented next and complete the meanings of the terms. Checking the meanings of the terms with a dictionary may prove helpful and add another dimension to your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information included under Laboratory Tests and Clinical Procedures and in the Abbreviations section relates to the gastrointestinal system and will be useful for work in clinical or laboratory medical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Practical Applications section gives you examples of medical language in context. Congratulate yourself as you decipher medical sentences, operative reports, and case studies.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
