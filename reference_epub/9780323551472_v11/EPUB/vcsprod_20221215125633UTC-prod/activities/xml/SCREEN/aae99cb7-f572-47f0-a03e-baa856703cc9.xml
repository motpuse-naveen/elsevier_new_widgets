  <text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jake Sheldon has type 1 diabetes, which was diagnosed when he was 8 years old. The following narrative was written by his mother, Ruthellen Sheldon, based on his teenage years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On school days, I wake up Jake at 6:30 AM. He tests his blood sugar by pricking his finger until it bleeds and sticking a test strip into the drop of blood. Then he inserts the strip into a small handheld glucometer and waits 3 to 5 seconds for a reading of his blood sugar. If this is 120 mg/dL or higher, he gives himself insulin 10 to 15 minutes before breakfast. The pump calculates how much insulin he needs to cover the carbs and any extra insulin he may need to bring down a high blood sugar. If his blood sugar is less than 120 mg/dL when he wakes up, he will wait until he takes his first bite of food to give himself his insulin to avoid hypoglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school day, if his blood sugar is high or low, he visits the nurse. If it’s high, he gives himself an insulin bolus or correction by pump. If his blood sugar is positive for ketones, he is sent home from school. If his blood sugar is low or less than 70, he eats or drinks some fast-acting sugar (Skittles, Smarties, or Sprite) and waits in the healthroom for his blood sugar to rise so he can return to class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the night, his dad and I set an alarm to wake up around 3 hours after bedtime. If his blood sugar is high while he sleeps, we use his pump to give him extra insulin, “a correction.” If it is low, we wake him and have him drink Sprite or eat Smarties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insulin pump is connected to his body with a small cannula [tube]. It is inserted manually via a needle into his hip region. The needle is then removed and the tiny Teflon cannula remains in his body, delivering fast-acting insulin under the skin. His pump is always connected to him with plastic tubing, and he carries it with him in his pants pocket. When he bathes, he disconnects the pump, and when he sleeps, he places it on the mattress next to his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jake is playing sports, he times his meals with the start of the activity so his blood sugar is around 150 mg/dL. He disconnects his pump during sports, and at halftime he tests his blood sugar. If it is low, he needs to eat. If it is high, he needs to reconnect his pump and administer more insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, Jake’s diabetes doesn’t disrupt his life other than the nighttime checks, wearing an insulin pump, and paying attention to how many carbs he eats. We encourage him to make good nutritional choices (not always easy for a kid) and to limit certain foods (doughnuts, Slurpees, candy) for special occasions. He must also carry a glucometer with him at all times and sugar to take when his blood glucose is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a child with diabetes forces me to carefully plan the preparation and timing of meals. I always have certain foods and medical supplies in the house and I also carry snacks and sugar sources wherever I go. My husband and I hope that keeping Jake’s blood sugar in tight control will help avoid many of the complications frequently encountered later in life by people with type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</text>

  <text>&lt;p&gt;Throughout high school, Jake took over all diabetes management tasks and managed his diabetes 100 percent independently before his graduation. Moving out of state to college, Jake has had to learned how cafeteria foods, late nights, and new social situations affect his blood sugars. Jake is also learning how to manage ordering and maintaining a vast number of diabetes supplies and prescriptions in his dorm room. Jake will also be transitioning from his pediatric endocrinologist to an adult endocrinologist this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruthellen Sheldon and her son, Jake, now 18 years old.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>
