  <text>&lt;p&gt;There are two phases of the heartbeat: &lt;strong&gt;diastole&lt;/strong&gt; (relaxation) and &lt;strong&gt;systole&lt;/strong&gt; (contraction). Diastole occurs when the ventricle walls relax and blood flows into the heart from the venae cavae and the pulmonary veins. The tricuspid and mitral valves open in diastole, as blood passes from the right and left atria into the ventricles. The pulmonary and aortic valves close at beginning of diastole. (Figure 11-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systole occurs next, as the walls of the right and left ventricles contract to pump blood into the pulmonary artery and the aorta. Both the tricuspid and the mitral valves are closed during systole, thus preventing the flow of blood back into the atria (see Figure 11-8). This diastole-systole cardiac cycle occurs between 70 and 80 times per minute (100,000 times a day). The heart pumps about 3 ounces of blood with each contraction. This means that about 5 quarts of blood are pumped by the heart in 1 minute (75 gallons an hour and about 2000 gallons a day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closure of the heart valves is associated with audible sounds, such as “lubb-dubb,” which can be heard on listening to a normal heart with a stethoscope. The “lubb” is associated with closure of the tricuspid and mitral valves at the beginning of systole, and the “dubb” with the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves at the end of systole. The “lubb” sound is called the first heart sound (S1) and the “dubb” is the second heart sound (S2), because the normal cycle of the heartbeat starts with the beginning of systole. Sometimes the flow of blood through the valves can produce an abnormal swishing sound known as a &lt;strong&gt;murmur&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</text>

  <text>&lt;p&gt;What keeps the heart at its perfect rhythm? Although the heart has nerves that affect its rate, they are not primarily responsible for its beat. The heart starts beating in the embryo before it is supplied with nerves, and continues to beat in experimental animals even when the nerve supply is cut.&lt;/p&gt;</text>

  <text>&lt;p&gt;Label Figure 11-9 as you read the following. Primary responsibility for initiating the heartbeat rests with a small region of specialized muscle tissue in the posterior portion of the right atrium, where an electrical impulse originates. This is the &lt;strong&gt;sinoatrial node (SA node),&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;pacemaker&lt;/strong&gt; [1] of the heart. The current of electricity generated by the pacemaker causes the walls of the atria to contract and force blood into the ventricles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost like ripples in a pond of water when a stone is thrown, the wave of electricity passes from the pacemaker to another region of the myocardium. This region is within the interatrial septum and is the &lt;strong&gt;atrioventricular node (AV node)&lt;/strong&gt; [2]. The AV node immediately sends the excitation wave to a bundle of specialized muscle fibers called the &lt;strong&gt;atrioventricular bundle&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;bundle of His&lt;/strong&gt; [3]. Within the interventricular septum, the bundle of His divides into the &lt;strong&gt;left bundle branch&lt;/strong&gt; [4] and the &lt;strong&gt;right bundle branch&lt;/strong&gt; [5], which form the conduction myofibers that extend through the ventricle walls and contract on stimulation. Thus systole occurs and blood is pumped away from the heart. A short rest period follows, and then the pacemaker begins the wave of excitation across the heart again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The record used to detect these electrical changes in heart muscle as the heart beats is an &lt;strong&gt;electrocardiogram&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;ECG&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;EKG&lt;/strong&gt;). The normal ECG tracing shows five waves, or deflections, that represent the electrical changes as a wave of excitation spreads through the heart. The deflections are called &lt;strong&gt;P, QRS,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt; waves. Figure 11-10 illustrates P, QRS, and T waves on a normal ECG tracing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart rhythm (originating in the SA node and traveling through the heart) is called &lt;strong&gt;normal sinus rhythm (NSR)&lt;/strong&gt;. Sympathetic nerves speed up the heart rate during conditions of emotional stress or vigorous exercise. Parasympathetic nerves slow the heart rate when there is no need for extra pumping.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
