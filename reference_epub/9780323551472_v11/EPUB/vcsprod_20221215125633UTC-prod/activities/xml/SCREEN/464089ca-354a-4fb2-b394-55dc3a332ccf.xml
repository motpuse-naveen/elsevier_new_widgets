  <text>&lt;p&gt;Maureen Pfeifer has been my extraordinary and indispensable editorial partner for the last 22 years. Her phenomenal expertise in all facets of communication, coordination, production, editing, updating, and management is amazing. She has the unique ability to “make things happen” and “make things right.” Both personally and professionally, I am grateful for her unique insight and capabilities. She is intelligent, calm, and upbeat in the face of any issue affecting The Language of Medicine and its ancillaries. Most of all, I rely on her loyalty and her confidence that we are creating an eminently useful and valuable textbook and resource for both students and instructors. Thank you, Maureen, for everything you do for me, especially when you take things “off my plate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruce A. Chabner, MD, and Elizabeth Chabner Thompson, MD, MPH, continue to be amazing resources to me for expert and up-to-date medical advice. Their contributions were essential in reviewing and editing all chapters and glossaries. My devoted friend, Dan Longo, MD, never turned me down for valuable medical advice and editing of chapters. He was also a wonderful resource for helping identify expert reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim Perkins, Assistant Professor of Medical Illustration, Rochester Institute of Technology, has been associated with &lt;em&gt;The Language of Medicine &lt;/em&gt;since its 6th edition. He has worked with me to create drawings that are not only attractive but also essential in making the terminology more understandable. I have come to rely on his unique talent for clarity, accuracy, and detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am indebted to the many medical reviewers listed on pages xv-xvi who offered essential advice and comments on specific chapters. Their insights and expertise make this 12th edition reflect what is current, accurate, and cutting edge in medicine today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classroom instructors listed on pages xvi-xvii extensively and carefully reviewed the text, and I have listened to their comments, which are integrated into this new edition. Many other instructors contacted me personally through email with helpful suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am always pleased to hear from students who comment on the book and ask important questions. I try to answer each as quickly and accurately as possible. Thanks to Shulamit Izen, Vashine Kamesan, Stephanie Kitchingham, Alfred Kyrollos, Rachel Recolcolin, Megan Peterson, Christina Sastre, Julia Sjoquist, Victoria Swanson, and Lan Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The In Person stories throughout the text are first-hand personal accounts of individuals dealing with illness and medical procedures. The writers of these stories are extraordinarily generous to share their insights and reactions so that we all benefit. A very special thank you to: Stan Ber, Nancy J. Brandwein, Mary Braun, Bruce A. Chabner, Lenore Estrada, Sidra DeKoven Ezrahi, Elizabeth F. Fideler, Tanzie Johnson, Kevin Mahoney, Frank McGinnis, Brenda Melson, John Melson, John Murphy, Laura Claridge Oppenheimer, Carolyn Peter, Bob Rowe, Ruthellen Sheldon, Elizabeth Chabner Thompson, Cathy Ward, and Kemisha White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The superb staff at Elsevier Health Sciences continues to be vital to the success of &lt;em&gt;The Language of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. Luke Held, Content Development Manager, is always responsive, available, and effective in managing the many details of the project. I appreciate Linda Woodard, Senior Content Strategist, for her expert management and steadfast support of my books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to Annie Martin, Director, Book Production, Jeff Patterson, Book ProductionManager, and Julie Eddy, Publishing Services Manager, for their superb production efforts. Abbie Bradberry, Book Production Specialist, tirelessly and effectively handled the day-to-day aspects of the production process. Thank you, Abbie! Kim Denando and Amy Buxton, created and directed the design for this edition. I appreciate their expertise and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I continue to be impressed by the talents of the entire marketing team, especially Julie Burchett, Senior Director of Product Portfolio Marketing and Samantha Page, Marketing Manager, Product Portfolio Marketing. They do a phenomenal job keeping &lt;em&gt;The Language of Medicine &lt;/em&gt;in-step with the needs of instructors and students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Manju Thirumalaivasan, Senior Multimedia Producer and Prakash Kannan, Multimedia Team Lead, for their work on the electronic products associated with this new edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very special note of gratitude to the extraordinary and devoted sales team at Elsevier Health Sciences, which is beyond compare! Led by Bryan Gripka, Vice President of Sales, this dedicated team works tirelessly to bring my books and learning system to the marketplace. You are the best!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family and friends continue to be my greatest comfort and support. The kids, Noonie, Brandon, and Marla, are always “in my corner.” The grandkids, Bebe, Solomon, Ben, Gus, Louisa, and Amari make me feel “on top of the world.” Juliana DoCarmo, by managing so many day-to-day responsibilities, allows me the luxury of being able to work and concentrate. I am grateful for Bob Williams, photographic specialist, who continues to provide expert advice on images throughout the book. My husband, Bruce, has always encouraged my passion for teaching and writing, and given me the space and time to enjoy both. I rely on his calm reassurance and his willingness to answer all questions medical or otherwise. Lastly, our canine kids, Ginger and Fred, remain the love of our lives, providing countless hours of excitement and enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
