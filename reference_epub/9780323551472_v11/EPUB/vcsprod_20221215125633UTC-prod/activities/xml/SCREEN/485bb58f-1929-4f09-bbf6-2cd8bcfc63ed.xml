  <text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#D24634;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Report 1: Major Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Carr, a 58-year-old widow, was brought to the emergency department by her daughter, who found her at home in bed in the middle of the day. For a period of months, Mrs. Carr had become increasingly withdrawn and dysphoric, without any precipitating events. She had become progressively less active and even required encouragement to eat and perform her daily tasks. Her daughter and son-in-law became alarmed but did not know what to do. Mrs. Carr’s medical history was unremarkable, but her psychiatric history revealed an episode of postpartum depression after the birth of one of her children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On examination, the ER [emergency room] physician noted that Mrs. Carr was withdrawn and negativistic, refusing to cooperate with the examination, and even refusing to open her mouth. There were signs of acute dehydration and decline in personal hygiene and grooming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further questioning of her daughter revealed that Mrs. Carr had become increasingly paranoid and had delusions of sinfulness and guilt. Recently, she had shown signs of increasing mutism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physician recognized signs of major depression and arranged for immediate hospitalization. Mrs. Carr responded favorably to combined use of an antipsychotic and an antidepressant drug. An alternative treatment would have been a course of electroconvulsive therapy, which also produces favorable results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#D24634;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Report 2: Somatic Symptom Disorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 35-year-old man presented with a 6-year history of abdominal pain that he was convinced was cancer. For most of his life, the patient evidently had been dominated by a tyrannical father who never gave him the love he craved. When the patient was 29, his father died of carcinoma of the colon, and soon afterward, the patient developed abdominal pain. His complaints gradually increased as his identification with his father, as well as his unconscious hostility toward him, increased. The patient came to the clinic almost daily with complaints of bloody stools (the feces were found to be free of blood) and the belief that he had cancer. He felt that none of the clinic doctors listened to him, just as his father had not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment included development of a longstanding, trusting, positive relationship with one of the clinic physicians, who allowed the patient time to talk about the illness. His symptoms gradually subsided during a 12-month period of a supportive physician-patient relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#CA500F;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Report 3: Bipolar Disorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 30-year-old woman first presented with depression at age 26. Her depression was characterized by sadness lasting most of the day, crying spells, severe irritability, hypersomnia with some periods of insomnia, anergia (low energy), severe inappropriate guilt feelings, and absence of libido (sex drive). The patient also described periods of high energy when her “mind ran away,” and her mood was irritable, with a decreased need for sleep. She stated that initially, these times would last 1 or 2 days at the most. Her family would avoid confrontations with her during those periods of energy and activity. The patient had previously been diagnosed as suffering from dysthymic disorder with major depression. A bipolar illness was suspected based on her 1- or 2-day bursts of energy and activity. History from family members confirmed that she had experienced expansive mood states lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day that met the DSM-5 criteria for hypomanic episodes. Her diagnosis was changed to bipolar II disorder. She was placed on a regimen of bupropion (Wellbutrin), and the dose was increased to 300 mg/day. Her mood improved in a general way, with less irritability, more energy, and less sadness. She continued to have rather pronounced premenstrual worsening of her mood, however, that did not respond to an increase in the dose of bupropion. In the meantime, her physician added lithium to her medical regimen of fluoxetine (Prozac).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#CA500F;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Report 4: Schizophrenia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike is a 33-year-old divorced man with two children, ages 8 and 10, whom he rarely ever sees. He has never been evaluated by a psychiatrist. His family physician has tried to get him to see a local psychiatrist, but Mike refuses to go. Mike says he knows someone has removed his brain and replaced it with someone else’s. He believes that this brain is controlling him and that he is not responsible for his actions. He works every day and has been on his current job for 15 years. He says he has lots of friends, but sometimes he thinks it’s one of them who did this to him. He reports incidents in which he has been injected with something while shopping and speaks of a government conspiracy to kill him. He has a college education and has a degree in computer science. His family physician ordered an MRI study, which showed negative findings, and he also had an EEG. The EEG results came back normal.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
