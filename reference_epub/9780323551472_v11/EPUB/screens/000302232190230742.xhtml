					<p><em>This first-person account was written by a young woman about her experience with Cushing syndrome.</em></p><p>I’ve always been a bit of a “skinny-Minnie” and had no major health issues. But in 1997 I started having irregular periods. Not only that, but I started gaining weight—6 to 9 pounds every month. I knew something was wrong.</p><p>This began my year-long journey with Cushing syndrome. Initially, I saw two general practitioners, had blood work done, and was told I was fine. As I gained more weight, Cushing’s symptoms became more apparent. I developed striae (purplish marks on my thighs *), a big round “moon face,” and a humpback.<sup>†</sup> I also became extremely fatigued when performing simple tasks. At the time, however, I had no idea or clue of what was happening.</p><p>Next, I saw my gynecologist. Again, more blood work, and I was told I’m fine. This process continued on with three other doctors. I pressed on from feeling misunderstood, depressed, and utterly tired and found an endocrinologist. After 3 months of testing, he located the problem: a tumor on my right adrenal gland. A month later I had a right adrenalectomy. Thankfully, my left adrenal works great, and I don’t have to take any hormone pills. I was also thrilled that the 72 pounds I gained over the year melted away in a few months.</p><p>I’ll never forget this experience. Having an unknown medical condition is very stressful. In some ways, I think I was even more stressed and depressed because my doctors seemed to dismiss my symptoms. I didn’t own a computer at the time, and I asked a friend to do some online research for me. I really felt I had to educate myself. I still don’t know what caused the adrenal gland tumor or if I could have prevented it. But I am pretty much back to normal, and my Cushing’s journey taught me to be a better advocate for myself.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><em>Tanzie Johnson is a professional photographer living in New York City.</em></p>
