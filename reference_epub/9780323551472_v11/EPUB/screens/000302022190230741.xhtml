					<p>When a friend told me she was sick with the ﬂu yesterday, I was jealous. To someone with a chronic illness, like me, having something acute always seems luxurious. Lie in bed, read glossy magazines, take overthe-counter meds, sleep it off, and in a matter of days you’re okay. I have Crohn disease, a chronic inﬂammation of the small intestine, which is characterized by ﬂare-ups and remission. During ﬂare-ups, I’ve experienced fever, diarrhea, vomiting, pain, and intestinal obstruction. Even in remission I am never “okay.”</p><p>Right now I have been in remission two years after a third surgery to remove yet another portion of my small bowel. This time internal bleeding, a rather rare symptom of Crohn’s, necessitated the surgery. I was enduring weekly iron infusions, which turned into bimonthly blood transfusions, as my hemoglobin plummeted to 6 (12 is normal). It was no way to live. After the surgery, the bleeding stopped, but I had bouts of urgent, watery diarrhea for a year. That was no way to live either, and unfortunately, as wonderful as my doctor is, I’ve found that few gastroenterologists want to address aftereffects of small bowel surgery. After visiting several doctors and by trial and error, I ﬁnally got these symptoms under control with codeine, Lomotil, and Metamucil, but I will never be able to absorb vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, so I must inject it monthly for the rest of my life. In addition to taking medicine to cope with having less and less small bowel, I take medicine in the hopes of preventing the next ﬂare-up. Every few weeks, I inject myself with a biologic medicine, Humira, but I must eventually be weaned off this drug because it has possible long-term side effects, the scariest of which is lymphoma. At 52 and with two school-age children, however, I have learned to think of valuing my present quality of life the most, over possible unknown dangers lurking in the future.</p><p>I do often think about the past. What would my life be like if our family doctor hadn’t told my parents that my constant episodes of diarrhea—which occurred since I was a child—were caused by “nerves?” By the time I was 21, my weight had dropped below 100 pounds, and I was twisted in pain after every meal. My dad arranged for me to visit his own doctor, who gave me a small bowel series that showed I had Crohn’s and that a portion of my small intestine was “as narrow as a pencil.” By then it was too late for even prednisone (then the drug of choice despite side effects ranging from puffy face to psychosis) to open up the inﬂamed passage, and I had my ﬁrst surgery just months after I was diagnosed. Thinking of those times—as well as all the other ﬂare-up times—makes me ﬂinch. While you can never relive pain, you can remember what it felt like. In my case, it was as if a large metal bike lock chain was being forced through my tender gut.</p><p>Before that ﬁrst surgery, I was just out of college and longing to make my mark on the world, but I spent most of my evenings curled up in my small bedroom, listening to the soothing strains of “Make Believe Ballroom Hour” on the radio. Or, because vomiting and diarrhea usually accompanied the pain, I lay with my back pressed against the cold tiles of the bathroom ﬂoor. Later on, as a mom with two young children, I would lie on the couch watching life swirl around me, feeling guilty that I could not take part.</p><p>There was a silver lining to those ﬂare-ups, and that is the tender affection of those around me: husband, family, and friends. When you have Crohn’s, no one knows you have it until things get unbearable. It’s not the kind of illness you discuss, but when you have pain and fever, you can kind of approximate those times of being felled by the ﬂu. Yet you know that it will take more than a dose of Nyquil or a night’s sleep to get “better.” You know you’ll face another course of medications—often untried ones—or that you will likely end up in the hospital undergoing yet another surgery.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><em>Nancy J.
