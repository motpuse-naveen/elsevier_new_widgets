					<p><em>This first-person narrative describes the symptoms and treatment of a woman with gallbladder stones.</em></p><p>Everyone enjoys a little dessert after dinner, but when the ice cream or a creamy tart leads to pain, most would avoid it. I loved sweets, and despite the revenge they took on my waistline, I still would not pass up an ice cream cone—until my gallbladder decided it had had enough. After several late nights spent doubled over in pain, I tried to steer clear of fatty foods but could not resist the temptation of frozen yogurt.</p><p>With one hand, I pushed my cart through the supermarket; with the other hand, I fed myself some delicious low-fat (not nonfat) frozen yogurt. I never dreamed that the attendant at the quick-service window actually gave me soft-serve ice cream. Within 10 minutes of eating the questionable yogurt, I broke out into a sweat; a wave of nausea took me, and a knifelike pain stabbed me in my right upper quadrant. It hurt even more when I pressed my hand on the area in an attempt to brace against the pain.</p><p>Several months earlier, after a similar painful episode, I had undergone an ultrasound of my gallbladder, and the surgeon then recommended cholecystectomy. The U/S showed multiple stones in my gallbladder. Most of the stones were just the right size to lodge in the common bile duct and cause blockage of the outflow of bile that occurs after a fatty meal. When I heard the ultrasound results, I swore off all fatty foods.</p><p>I just did not imagine that ice cream masquerading as “low-fat yogurt” would be the straw that broke the camel’s back! Soon enough, I abandoned my shopping cart and apologized to the manager of the store for vomiting all over aisle 4. The unrelenting pain did not cease when I vomited—it only intensified. I have no idea how I made it home and into bed, but my husband found me several hours later in a deep sweat. I managed to call my surgeon and arrange for “semi-emergent” surgery the next morning.</p><p>Dr. Fernandez and his team performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and relayed to me as I came out of anesthesia that I no longer had a “bag of marbles” for a gallbladder. I had a gassy, distended feeling in my abdomen over the two weeks after surgery (carbon dioxide gas was injected into the abdomen before surgery to allow space between abdominal organs). I felt “tight as a drum” for the first few days, and then day by day it went away. My four tiny incisions healed just fine, and in about 2 weeks I was feeling back to “normal.” Now I can eat ice cream to my heart’s content, only suffering the padding on my waistline, not the stabbing pain just above. Without missing a beat, my liver now delivers the bile into my small intestine right after I eat a fatty meal. The bile emulsifies (breaks down) the fat. I just don’t have a storage bag to hold bile in reserve.</p><p>I’ve had an appendectomy, my wisdom teeth removed, and now I gave up my gallbladder! How many more “useless” body parts are there to go?</p><p style="text-align: right;"><em>Elizabeth Chabner Thompson is the CEO/Founder of Masthead, a company devoted to bringing innovative products to patients with breast cancer. She is a physician, swimmer, cross country skier and the proud mother of four children ages 16-21.</em></p>
