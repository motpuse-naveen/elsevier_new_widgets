					<p><em>This account was written by a medical oncologist who specializes in the treatment of patients with lymphoma.</em></p><p>Of the many challenges of practicing medical oncology, the treatment of patients with lymphoma is among the most satisfying, and at times the most difficult. Lymphomas were the first common solid tumor to become curable with drugs alone. In 1969, investigators at the National Cancer Institute published their promising results with combination chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma. At that time, this was a tumor that was treatable and curable with radiation therapy in only a small fraction of patients, when disease was limited to involvement of only a few lymph nodes. Very soon thereafter, chemotherapy proved to be curative for almost one half of patients with a more aggressive disease— large B cell lymphocytic lymphoma, a malignancy that affects 20,000 new subjects every year in the United States. In succeeding years, for patients not cured with conventional drugs, bone marrow transplantation following ultra-high-dose chemotherapy salvaged at least half of those patients who experienced a relapse of disease. New drugs, particularly monoclonal antibodies that attack proteins on the surface of tumors and initiate immune destruction of tumors, have added to that success. Thus, at present, with use of chemotherapy, irradiation, and high-dose drug treatment, most patients with lymphoma can be cured.</p><p>The experience of treating a patient with lymphoma is not simple. The first step is making the correct diagnosis, which requires obtaining an adequate biopsy specimen from the involved lymph nodes, bone marrow, or other disease sites. Next, the physician must establish the sites and extent of disease. This requires x-ray, MR imaging of the lungs, and spinal cord PET/CT (combination of nuclear medicine and computed tomography tests). The choice of drug regimens and other treatments depends on making a correct assessment of these factors.</p><p>The doctor must explain all of this information to the patient so that he or she has a clear understanding of what lies ahead. The long-term plan of management involves numerous hospital outpatient visits for evaluation and treatment, including possible biopsy and repeat biopsy of sites of disease to establish whether the tumor has been effectively treated. I also spend considerable time with patients explaining the potential side effects of treatments, some of which can affect the lungs, heart, and immune system. In addition, patients need guidance after chemotherapy about susceptibility to serious infections when blood counts are low. Overall, the psychological stress and uncertainty of outcome plus the impact on work and family responsibilities make the need for support from friends and family crucial.</p><p>For most patients, all of these issues are successfully managed during treatment, and no experience is more gratifying for me, as an oncologist, than to achieve cure of a potentially lethal disease. All of this is accomplished at a price. For a few patients, the stresses of disease and its impact on family and work prove nearly overwhelming. I call upon the intervention of social workers, nurses, and even psychiatrists to help my patients deal with the difficulty of disease and life-changing experiences. The added rigors of bone marrow transplantation increase the burden on patients who are not cured by conventional treatments. Finally, even more stressful and demanding are the challenges faced by those patients, a minority to be sure, whose disease progresses despite all interventions, and who are destined not to survive. For these patients, experimental treatments at times are the best option and again may reverse the downward course. Through it all, as a physician, I find that we must all work as a team to provide the best medical advice, psychological support, and hope for 60,000 new patients who develop lymphoma each year.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><em>Dr. Bruce A.
