				<p><em>This is a first-person account of a woman in her mid-forties living with sciatica.</em></p><p>Twelve years ago, I wouldn’t have believed that reaching into a laundry basket could change my life. But in January 2009, it did.</p><p>I had gotten my first-ever backache a few days earlier, after a long car trip. A Google search instructed me to apply ice for the first 48 hours and then heat if the pain persisted. My husband took over the kids’schoolday routine while I recuperated. That third morning, I could hear my younger son rifling around for his favorite sweatshirt; I knew it was at the foot of my bed, waiting to be sorted. In the instant it took to reach into the laundry basket for that sweatshirt, my back went from dull ache to a crippling pain that radiated all the way down my left leg to the tip of my left foot.</p><p>An MRI scan confirmed the diagnosis: spinal disc herniation, protruding onto the nerve roots affecting the sciatic nerve and causing my leg pain. With surgery presented as a last resort, I embarked on a crash course of physical therapy, NSAIDs, oral steroids, muscle relaxants, epidural steroid injections, and lots and lots of patience. I saw gradual improvement for about three months, to the point that I was able to resume a modified daily routine.</p><p>Then, the improvement stopped. Conventional treatment had run its course. I was at the “last resort” stage. So I “cried uncle” and requested a surgical consult. The surgeon ordered a follow-up MRI, which showed good news: There had been much improvement to the herniation. To my surprise, the MRI also revealed that nerve roots supplying the sciatic nerve were now free and clear of impingement. If the nerve was back to normal, why was I still in such pain? Because, it turns out, the nerve was injured by its ordeal. Not uncommon, I was reassured. This development took the surgical option off the table. After all, the goal of the surgery would have been to relieve the affected nerve from compression by the protruding disc. In my case, even the relieved nerve was causing problems, and that meant not surgery, but more patience. The wait began: to see whether the nerve would repair itself—I was told that could take years—or worse, whether I was facing permanent nerve damage.</p><p>Three years later the verdict seems clear: my sciatic nerve sustained what appears to be permanent damage. To this day, I have not regained full use of my left leg. Along with chronic, dull pain, there are also paresthesias—simultaneous burning and numbness along the path of the sciatic nerve accompanied by constant involuntary muscle spasms. I’ve lost my Achilles jerk reflex, and so unresponsive is my left foot that I can’t feel it hit the ground when I’m walking.</p><p>In those critical first months, I thought my options were either resolving the herniation with surgery or resolving it without surgery. It never once occurred to me that, four years later, the injury would remain unresolved.</p><p>There’s always a new treatment, specialist, or drug that shows promise or that really worked for a friend of a friend. Until recently, it felt like I was giving up hope if I didn’t pursue each lead. Now I’m focusing more on adapting to my new circumstances than on finding a “cure.” I don’t want my whole life to revolve around sciatica. I found a medication that reduces the chronic pain to more of an annoyance than a crisis (with occasional flare-ups).</p><p>I missed my old life and wanted it back. At the risk of sounding like a late-night pharmaceutical ad, I’m not giving up; I’m going on.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><em><strong>AUTHOR’S NOTE</strong> Everyone’s experience with sciatica is unique. I have also experienced the condition myself, resulting from an L4-L5 disk herniation. After 7 months of pain radiating down my right leg, I had </em><i>microdiscectomy</i><em> surgery, which fortunately alleviated my pain and sciatica.</em></p>
