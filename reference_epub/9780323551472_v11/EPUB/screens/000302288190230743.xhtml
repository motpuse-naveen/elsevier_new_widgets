				<p><em>This first-person account was written by the mother of a young boy diagnosed with autism.</em></p><p>“What you do from now on will determine whether your son will be able to live on his own as an adult or whether he will have to live in a facility.”</p><p>I was told this by a physician when my son, Jeff, was diagnosed with autism.</p><p>It began early on. For the first year of his life, Jeff had difficulty tolerating many situations and often cried. Loud noises such as barking dogs, motorcycles, and the trash truck sent him into a crying frenzy. If he was in a quiet room, in a swing, or being held, he was comfortable. Most other situations he could tolerate for only 60 to 90 minutes, after which he would cry for 20 to 30 minutes as if relieving stress. As Jeff aged, his tolerance slowly increased, but even at the age of 4, overstimulation caused him to cry daily.</p><p>Jeff experienced numerous other challenges as well. His ability to play was impaired. If a toy did not light up or play music he was not interested in it. The exception was Matchbox cars, which he did enjoy. However, he did not play with them appropriately. He merely lined them up. Jeff never engaged in imaginative play, nor could he carry on a back-and-forth conversation. His speech was rote, and he had extreme difficulty communicating and relating to peers.</p><p>After visiting several doctors in search of a diagnosis, we were told Jeff was autistic. We also learned that his discomfort and crying were a result of sensory integration challenges that children on the autism spectrum experience. Sensory integration is the process of organizing useful perceptions, emotions and thoughts. When sensory integration is whole and balanced, body movements are highly adaptive and good behavior is a natural outcome. This was not the case with Jeff.</p><p>It was difficult to accept the diagnosis, but we had to move on. The next step was finding proper treatment for Jeff. After much consideration, we decided on DIR/Floortime [Developmental, Individual Difference, Relationship-Based–Floortime] Therapy (“Floortime”), supplemented with occupational therapy (OT), to address Jeff’s sensory integration needs.</p><p>Floortime is a play-based treatment, focusing on helping children master the building blocks of relating, communicating, and thinking. Guided interactions between the child and parent, sibling, grandparent, or caregiver move the child through six Floortime developmental stages, which are:</p><ol><li>Self-Regulation and Shared Attention</li><li>Engagement and Relating</li><li>Two-way Intentional Communication</li><li>Purposeful Complex Problem Solving/Communication</li><li>Creating Ideas</li><li>Logical Reasoning, Thinking Logically</li></ol><p>I was taught Floortime by a professional and spent nights watching instructional videos and reading Floortime books. I worked with Jeff each day, including Saturday and Sunday. We did Floortime constantly even during meals, riding in the car, and during bath time. I was working for my son’s future. The more therapy he received, the better his chances of “recovery.” No opportunity was missed.</p><p>Each week, over the course of several years, our program leader would assess Jeff’s development and determine when he had mastered a skill and when further interventions were needed.</p><p>Over several years, Floortime was resolving Jeff’s developmental issues, and OT was helping his sensory integration issues, but another problem was becoming more extreme. By first grade, Jeff had developed anxiety that was so irrational and overwhelming that it impaired his school, social and family life. He was very fearful and always thinking about the worst things that could happen. Conversations often would “spin out of control” as Jeff worried irrationally about things that might happen to him. During these times, I would attempt to distract him, only to have the anxiety recur.</p><p>As time went on, Jeff not only was verbalizing his anxiety, but manifested other unconscious behaviors such as eye and verbal tics, chewing on his shirt, and pulling on his hair.</p><p>Our team of doctors did not have a specific answer for Jeff’s anxiety. We tried numerous treatments including psychotherapy, desensitization therapy, applied behavioral therapy, occupational body-regulating therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. None had much effect on reducing anxiety.</p><p>Finally, one of our doctors suggested a study at a nearby university, which was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. The program was specifically designed for children on the autism spectrum suffering from very high levels of anxiety. It was a treatment protocol based on a collaborative, family-based intervention approach using targeted cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques. It took into consideration Jeff’s spectrum-based deficits and taught him how his anxiety could be managed by using a coping plan and actively facing his fears. The program lasted nearly a year. But we used it regularly for months after it ended. It had a noticeable positive impact on Jeff’s anxiety.</p><p>By his fourth-grade year, Jeff’s physical size of 5′ 0″ and 80 pounds allowed his child psychiatrist to prescribe antianxiety medication. This has made a real difference in his functioning and well-being.</p><p>Today Jeff is is a mainstreamed student at a public middle school. He is able to relate to others with real warmth. He has a core group of good friends, a love of learning, and a mischievous sense of humor. His anxiety remains his biggest challenge but is under control with medication and psychotherapy.</p><p>Through it all, my family and I have learned that with the proper therapies and treatments, we can define an autistic child’s potential not by assumed limitations, but by that child’s own growth.</p>
