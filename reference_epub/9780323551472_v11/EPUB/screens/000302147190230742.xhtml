					<p>When I began noticing persistent back pain and fatigue in 2006, my doctor and I didn’t take the symptoms seriously until 2007, when I noticed I was losing weight and short of breath. I saw a lung specialist, who took a chest x-ray and discovered a mass the size of a grapefruit in my mediastinum. Immediately, my stress level went sky high, and being 25 in New York City on my own (my family was in California and my mother was going through metastatic breast cancer treatment), I felt afraid and alone.</p><p>I was scheduled for a PET-CT scan and visited a friend who was a radiation oncologist. She was alarmed by my symptoms and appearance and through her father, a medical oncologist, immediately put me in contact with a cancer specialist. The results from the PET-CT plus bronchoscopy with a biopsy, and a bone marrow biopsy conﬁrmed that I had Stage 2B Hodgkin lymphoma with “bulky disease” [large tumor mass] in my mediastinum. This diagnosis was really scary for me. But watching my mother go through her difﬁcult battle with breast cancer made me realize that if I emulated her positive attitude, it would make life easier for my entire family.</p><p>The treatment was six cycles of chemotherapy. After two cycles, enough of my hair started falling out that I shaved my head. A Powerport was installed in my upper chest so that I could receive the chemotherapy more quickly and with less pain. Because I was so young, I received hormones to put my body into temporary menopause, to preserve my fertility.</p><p>Three months into my treatment a PET-CT showed that the mass was still large, and it was likely that I would need radiation to my chest after the chemotherapy. By the time that I was ﬁnishing my chemotherapy, I was having a difﬁcult time coping with the ongoing side effects and time in the hospital. Nevertheless, I rallied and traveled to Boston for 4 weeks of proton [powerful radiation] therapy. I actually felt lucky to be receiving this cutting-edge treatment, delivered by one of the few proton beam machines in the country.</p><p>My radiation treatment ended in 2008, and a follow-up PET-CT scan would tell me if I needed further treatment. I remember when the doctor told me that the scan was all clear, I said, “Great!”—and then went outside and cried on a bench for an hour. More recently, I’ve been getting follow-up scans every year. Honestly, I’m relieved when the scan is clear, but I am also afraid and aware of the possibility of recurrence and of developing a secondary cancer as a result of the extensive radiation treatment. Since my mother passed away in 2013, I’ve been getting regular mammograms, and because of the radiation effects on my thyroid gland, I’m taking thyroid hormone to treat hypothyroidism.</p><p>I know that my Hodgkin lymphoma experience will always be with me, but I still have an inherently positive attitude, which has enabled and empowered me to start a new, exciting business and think optimistically about the future.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><em> Lenore Estrada is the CEO and Co-Founder of Three Babes Bakeshop, a pie business in San Francisco that works to bring awareness to the economic, social and environmental issues at play in working-class American communities.
