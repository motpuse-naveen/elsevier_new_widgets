					<p>I was scheduled for a stem cell transplant to cure my recurrent primary central nervous system lymphoma, or PCNSL, a rare type of brain cancer. Until around 15 years ago, stem cell transplants depended upon bone marrow from which to harvest the cells. Since then, scientists have discovered that there are actually more cells available in peripheral (circulating) blood than in marrow. I was given two medicines, Mozobil and Neupogen, aimed at stimulating enough stem cells to be collected from that peripheral source. In a peripheral autologous blood stem cell transplant, stem cells are collected from the circulating blood by apheresis, in which blood is withdrawn through a sterile needle, and passed through a machine that harvests stem cells into a container, while the remaining blood components are then transferred back into the patient’s bloodstream. The fraction containing the blood stem cells is then frozen until needed for transplantation. Because patients get their own cells back, no chance exists for immune mismatch or graft-versus-host problems.</p><p>On the first day of stem cell collection, I produced half of the total stem cells I would need for my treatment. By the end of the third day of collection, I had reached the magic number of stem cells needed, and was able to go home to wait for the hospital to schedule me for the transplant. A representative phoned 2 days later, laying out the next 5 weeks for me: I’d be admitted in 11 days to the transplant division, where I would remain, they hoped, for no more than a month. My (presumably clean) stem cells were safely stored in a freezer while I was to undergo intensive chemotherapy meant to destroy any lurking cancer cells in my brain (and of course, benign others in the medicine’s “take-no-prisoners” path).</p><p>I was glad when the date arrived, and my husband Dennis moved me into my next month’s home on the eighth floor of the hospital. What I had failed to understand is the nature of an autologous stem cell transplant, at least for primary CNS lymphoma. I was to be blasted, rendered helpless, with a trio of chemo agents able to pass through the blood-brain barrier, but not ordinarily available for treatment-as-a-threesome due to their combined viciousness: busulfan, thiotepa (mustard gas–related), and cyclophosphamide (also a nitrogen mustard alkylating agent). I could risk receiving these killers because my uncontaminated stem cells were stored in the freezer. They would eventually replace my currently circulating blood that was being saturated with chemotherapy agents.</p><p>After 9 days, my white blood count was as low as it could go: I was at ground zero, “my second birthday.” The blood we’d collected with the help of Mozobil and company was slowly thawed, for a few hours, and soon I was given a transfusion of my previously frozen blood, swarming with stem cells. Before long, I felt so sick I thought I was dying. Wearing diapers that had to be changed every 20 minutes, having rectal samples taken from my chafed, sometimes bloody “toilet skin” (as the nurse called it), being forced to sit up every minute, even at night, so that I could put the suction tube down my throat to keep from drowning in the rope-like mucositis, which ulcerated the membranes lining my digestive system—I could go on and on.</p><p>But as I’d been promised, nearly 5 weeks post-admission for the life-giving stem cell transplant, I was deemed ready to go home. For a month, however, our house operated like a medical office. That first week, I kept down half a shake a day. When I returned for my first checkup, I had to stay an extra 5 hours for a hydration infusion. Four days later, my red blood count was low and I needed a transfusion. By the second week, I’d started eating Cheerios with milk throughout the day, and my weight at least stabilized. I no longer looked like a skeleton.</p><p>At 100 days post-transplant, we could make love again. I worried that Dennis would find my scrawniness a turnoff, but he accepted my new “boy’s body” and enthusiastically helped me recapture my faith in our oneness. After all, we’d been through the battle and needed now to smell the perennial flowers. Turns out they’re as colorful as ever.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><em>Laura Claridge Oppenheimer is a writer with Farrar, Straus and Giroux.<br /> She just finished a novel, Loving Hard.
