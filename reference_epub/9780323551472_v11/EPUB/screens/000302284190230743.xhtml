				<p><strong>Psychotherapy </strong>is the treatment of emotional problems and disorders using psychological techniques. The following are psychotherapeutic techniques used by psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health professionals.</p><p><strong>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). </strong>This is a relatively short-term, focused psychotherapy for a wide range of psychological problems, including depression, anxiety, anger, marital conflict, fears, and substance abuse. The focus is on how the person who is experiencing difficulty is thinking, behaving, and communicating today, rather than on early childhood experiences. Because CBT is based on the idea that thoughts cause feelings and behaviors (not people, situations, or events), if the person can change established ways of thinking, then he or she can feel better even if the situation does not change. CBT techniques often are used to reduce anxiety.</p><p><strong>Family Therapy.</strong> Treatment of an entire family can help the individual members resolve and understand their conflicts and problems.</p><p><strong>Group Therapy. </strong>In a group with a mental health professional leader as a neutral moderator, patients with similar problems gain insight into their own personalities through discussions and interaction with each other. In <strong>psychodrama</strong>, patients express their feelings by acting out family and social roles along with other patient-actors on a stage. After a scene has been presented, the audience (composed of other patients) is asked to make comments and offer interpretations about what they have observed.</p><p><strong>Hypnosis</strong>. A <strong>trance</strong> (state of altered consciousness) is created to help in recovery of deeply repressed memories. Hypnotic techniques also are used for anxiety reduction, for creating a sense of psychological safety, and for problem solving.</p><p><strong>Insight-Oriented Psychotherapy</strong>. This type of psychotherapy uses face-to-face discussion of life problems and associated feelings. The aim is to increase understanding of underlying conflicts, themes, thoughts, and behavior patterns.</p><p><strong>Play Therapy.</strong> In this form of therapy, the child uses play with toys to express conflicts and feelings that he or she is unable to communicate verbally.</p><p><strong>Psychoanalysis. </strong>This long-term, intense psychotherapy seeks to influence behavior and resolve internal conflicts by allowing patients to bring their unconscious emotions to the surface. Through techniques such as <strong>free association</strong> (patient speaks his or her thoughts one after another without censorship), <strong>transference</strong> (patient relates to the therapist as if to a person who figured prominently in early childhood, such as a parent or sibling), and <strong>dream interpretation</strong>, the patient is able to bring unconscious emotional conflicts to awareness and thus can overcome these problems.</p><p><strong>Sex Therapy.</strong> This form of therapy can help people overcome sexual dysfunctions such as <strong>frigidity </strong>(inhibited sexual response in women), <strong>impotence </strong>(inability of a man to achieve and/or maintain an erection), and <strong>premature ejaculation</strong> (release of semen before coitus can be achieved).</p><p><strong>Supportive Psychotherapy.</strong> The therapist offers encouragement, support, and hope to patients facing difficult life transitions and events.</p>

				<p>In <strong>electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)</strong>, an electrical current is applied to the brain (usually to one hemisphere) after the patient is anesthetized, with assisted ventilation, and given a very short-acting muscle paralytic agent. Actual physical convulsions are therefore imperceptible. This therapy is used chiefly for serious depression and the depressive phase of bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder. ECT is a particularly effective treatment for psychotic depression and can be life-saving when a rapid response is needed.</p>

				<p>The following are categories of drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders. Figure 22-4 reviews these groups and lists specific drugs in each category.</p><ul><li><strong>Antianxiety and antipanic agents.</strong> These drugs lessen anxiety, tension, and agitation, especially when they are associated with panic attacks. Examples are <strong>benzodiazepines (BZDs)</strong>, which act rapidly as antianxiety angents, sedatives, or anticonvulsants (clonazepam). Benzodiazepines directly affect the brain to stabilize the transmission of excitatory nerve impulses. Other antianxiety and antipanic agents are <strong>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</strong>. These agents prevent the reuptake of serotonin (a neurotransmitter) into nerve endings, allowing it to linger in the space between it and the next nerve cell.</li><li><strong>Antidepressants</strong>. These drugs gradually reverse depression and return the patient to a more even state, with less persistent and less severe depressive symptoms. The basic cause of depression is thought to be related to neurotransmitters in the brain. Several groups of drugs are used as antidepressants. These include:</li></ul><ol style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><strong>SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) </strong>such as fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft). They improve mood, mental concentration, physical activity, and sleep patterns.</li><li><strong>SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors)</strong> are antidepressant drugs that modulate the two neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. Examples are venlafaxine (Effexor), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq), and duloxetine (Cymbalta). Other antidepressants that do not fit into defined categories are bupropion (Wellbutrin) and trazodone (Desyrel).</li><li><strong>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). </strong>These drugs contain three fused rings in their chemical structure (hence the designation <em>tricyclic</em>). TCAs restore the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain to relieve depression.</li><li><strong>Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.</strong> These drugs suppress an enzyme, monoamine oxidase, that normally breaks down neurotransmitters. MAO inhibitors are not as widely prescribed as other antidepressants because serious cardiovascular and liver complications can occur with their use. Significant dietary restrictions also are necessary to avoid adverse reactions.</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Antiâ€“obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) agents.</strong> These drugs are prescribed to relieve the symptoms of OCD. Tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs are examples of these agents.</li><li><strong>Antipsychotics (neuroleptics).</strong> These drugs suppress psychotic symptoms and behavior (Greek <em>lepsis </em>means a taking hold). <strong>Atypical antipsychotics</strong> are the major examples. They are used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other mental illnesses. They reduce anxiety, tension, agitation, and aggressiveness and modify psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. Older drugs, such as <strong>first generation</strong> (early) <strong>antipsychotics</strong>, such as <strong>phenothiazines</strong>, are still used as well. An important potential adverse effect of older neuroleptic drugs taken over long periods is <strong>tardive dyskinesia (TD)</strong>; tardive means late, and dyskinesias are abnormal movements. This is a potentially irreversible condition marked by involuntary movements. Early detection is important.<br />The AIMS (abnormal involuntary movement scale) is used to monitor patients for signs of TD. Weight gain and increased risk for developing diabetes also are important side effects of atypical antipsychotics.</li><li><strong>Mood stabilizers.</strong> These drugs are used primarily to treat patients with the mood changes associated with bipolar disorder. <strong>Lithium </strong>is commonly used to reduce the frequency and severity of manic symptoms, such as rapid speech, hyperactive movements, grandiose ideas, agitation and irritability, and impaired sleep patterns (decreased need for sleep is typical). It also is used as an adjunct in the treatment of depression. Lithium is a simple salt that is thought to stabilize nerve membranes. <strong>Anticonvulsant drugs</strong> (valproate and lamotrigine) also are used as mood stabilizers.</li><li><strong>Hypnotics</strong>. These drugs are used to produce sleep (hypn/o = sleep) and relieve insomnia. Examples are sedatives and benzodiazepines.</li><li><strong>Stimulants</strong>. These drugs<strong> (amphetamines) </strong>are prescribed for <strong>attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder</strong> in children and, to a lesser extent, adults. Common manifestations of ADHD are a short attention span and easy distractibility, emotional unstability, impulsivity, and moderate to severe hyperactivity.</li></ul>
