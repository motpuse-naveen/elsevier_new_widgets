					<p>While growing up in West Virginia in the 1940s and 50s, I was frighteningly aware of the prevalence of lung diseases. With coal mining at its peak, large numbers of miners suffered and died from black lung disease. Tuberculosis was not uncommon, and neither was pneumonia. Little did I imagine, then or in 1999, when I first contracted the disease, that recurring pneumonia would become my most troublesome medical issue.</p><p>As bitter cold temperatures persisted during the winter of 1999, I was not particularly concerned about a lingering cold and cough. But when I developed a low-grade fever and decreased energy, a chest x-ray confirmed that I had pneumonia in my left lung (lower lobe). My doctor prescribed a one-week course of antibiotics and reassured me that the diagnosis was not unusual. I quickly improved and a follow-up x-ray showed that the pneumonia had cleared. My doctor then suggested that I receive the pneumonia vaccine, which produces antibodies against many types of pneumococcal bacteria. End of story. Or so I thought.</p><p>In October of 2001, at age 60, I began training to run the Boston Marathon. A few days after a long training run in January of 2002, I could not stop coughing. Once again, a low-grade fever and rather marked fatigue set in. The thought of pneumonia did not cross my mind initially. But, when symptoms didn’t improve, a visit to my doctor and a chest x-ray confirmed my second diagnosis of pneumonia, again in my left lower lobe. I felt some relief when my physician, a pulmonologist and a serious runner himself, assured me that cold weather training had not caused the pneumonia. After a course of antibiotics, a follow-up chest CT performed in May showed no abnormal result, and bronchoscopy ruled out any malignancy. Relieved, I assumed I was finished with pneumonia.</p><p>However, pneumonia wasn’t finished with me. I had periods where I went almost 6 years without a recurrence, but over and over, despite pulmonary function tests that were normal and trials of steroids, I seem to always end up with pneumonia when I develop even the slightest “cold.”</p><p>With all the information, gathered and evaluated by experts, what happens next? At this point, the doctors conclude that my pneumonia is probably idiopathic. They suggest that I have a follow-up CT scan and additional testing when pneumonia episodes actually occur. They also caution me about exposure around children and hospitalized patients. I asked my lung specialist if he thought this pneumonia puzzle would ever be resolved. His reply was, “Something is going on that we will eventually understand. We just haven’t figured it out yet.” Unsettling and stress producing as this has been, I know I am fortunate to be dealing with an illness that has, so far, responded to medication. Still, every time I get cold signs and symptoms, I worry. And I never take good health for granted.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><em>Brenda Melson’s professional career was in teaching, counseling, and college advising.</em></p>
